# RockPaperScissors
This was my first project with Java Script, completed as part of The Odin Project.
(https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)

** What I learned:  **
- Try out short snippets of code before incorporating them into a project.
- The cause of and solution to a problem aren't always what I think they are at first.
- Be prepared to try out different ideas and throw them out if necessary.
- Git branching (the very basics)!
