# RockPaperScissors
Revised version of Rock Paper Scissors using DOM manipulation, completed as part of the The Odin Project ( https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors) Foundations Course (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)

** What I learned:  **

- Try out short snippets of code before incorporating them into a project.
- The cause of and solution to a problem aren't always what I think they are at first.
- Be prepared to try out different ideas and throw them out if necessary.
- Git branch and merge
- DRY (still learning!)
- Using Event Listeners, specifically dealing with the fact that their return value is none (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)
- Adding and changing backgrounds
- Using setTimeout to delay execution of script
- Destructuring
